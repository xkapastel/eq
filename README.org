Eq is a blockchain database.

* Bytecode
Eq bytecode is a [[http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html][concatenative language.]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
         [A] app  = A
         [A] box  = [[A]]
     [A] [B] cat  = [A B]
         [A] copy = [A] [A]
         [A] drop =
     [A] [B] swap = [B] [A]
         [A] fix  = [[A] fix A]
         [A] run  = { A }
{ E [F] shift K } = { [E] [K] F }
#+END_SRC

* Feeds
Eq dictionaries are published as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)][Atom feeds]]. The content of each post
in the feed is Markdown; the code blocks inside contain transactions
of the form:

#+BEGIN_SRC
:key value    Assign `value` to `key`.
~key          Delete `key`.
#+END_SRC

The dictionary is reconstructed by executing feed items in
chronological order.
