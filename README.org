Eq is a blockchain database.

* Language
Eq is a concatenative language like Joy. If you're not familiar with
concatenative languages, [[http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html][this is a very good introduction to the
subject.]]

Γ := B

Γ :- [F] [G] forall
Γ :- [F] type
Γ :- [G] type

* Dictionary
The /dictionary/ is a key/value store associating words with code.

A /block/ is a newline delimited list of transactions against the
current dictionary. Executing a sequence of blocks constructs a
dictionary.

A transaction can define a new key:

#+BEGIN_SRC
:key value...
#+END_SRC

A transaction can delete a key:

#+BEGIN_SRC
~key
#+END_SRC
